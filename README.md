# English Vocab Builder

A quiz-based mobile app built with Flutter to help users improve their English vocabulary through engaging, interactive learning. Designed for students, competitive exam aspirants, and language learners of all levels, the app blends gamification and active recall principles to promote long-term retention of words and meanings.

## Features

- Multiple Choice Vocabulary Quizzes  
  Context-based questions with four options help users develop both accuracy and speed.

- YAML-Based Dynamic Questions  
  Questions are stored in easily editable YAML files categorized by difficulty and part of speech.

- Easy Content Updates  
  Quiz data is not hardcoded — new questions can be added or updated by simply modifying the YAML files, without needing to change the app code.
  

## Learning Approach

The app uses:

- Active Recall: Reinforcing memory by retrieving the correct word under mild time pressure.
- Semantic Proximity: Powered by WordNet and curated datasets to build contextual understanding rather than rote memorization.

## Technologies Used

- Flutter for UI development  
- Firebase for backend support and future scalability  
- Provider for state management  
- yaml package for question parsing  
- Material Design components for a clean and intuitive interface
